## Dashboard
![alt text](/images/Screenshot%20from%202025-01-17%2016-21-22.png)

The image shows the DuckieTown dashboard of our duckiebot (csc22936). On the top are the motor signals, which are linear speed (how many meters the duckiebot is moving per second), motor speed (how fast each motor is moving), and angular speed (how many radians the duckiebot if turning per second). The bottom section shows the camera signal coming from the front camera of the duckiebot at 8 frames per second.

## Running the Duckiebot Program

The image shows the output of the program running on the the Docker image built on the duckiebot. The program `message = "Hello from %s!" % os.environ['VEHICLE_NAME']` retrieves the environment variable VEHICLE_NAME (in our case csc22936) and prints it onto the terminal.

## Calibration

The first screenshot shows the instrinsic .yaml file for camera calibration. The intrinsic calibration is done by displaying a predetermined grid pattern to the duckiebot's camera and allowing the duckiebot to solve for its camera parameters. The values of the matrices shown are used to project 3D points in the world to 2D points in images while considering the influence of the distortion.

The second screenshot shows the extrinsic .yaml file for camera calibration. During the extrinsic calibration, the same grid is displayed facing up from the ground, and the robot is expected to find the homography between the image from the camera and the actual image. The resulting homography parameters are shown in the extrinsic .yaml file.
