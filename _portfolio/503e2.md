## ROS Basics
Nodes in ROS are running processes that perform certain designated tasks. The idea of using nodes in ROS is to reduce coupling between programs and to provide additional fault tolerance in case any nodes fail. Nodes can be combined into a graph and can communicate with each other using topics, which are channels where messages are sent and received by publishers and subscribers. The messages are data structures with pre-specified typed fields. Nodes can publish messages to the ROS topics, and subscribe to topics to continuously receive and process messages in a decoupled manner. Alternatively, nodes can communicate with each other using services, which provide a synchronous request-response mechanism. A ROS node can provide a service for client nodes to send a request and wait to receive information carried by a single reply. The one-to-one relationship between the request message and the reply message defines the service. The messages used in communication between nodes can be recorded into a bag file in both online and offline settings. In ROS, the data carried by bags can be further processed, analyzed and visualized for better understanding of the robot behaviours.
