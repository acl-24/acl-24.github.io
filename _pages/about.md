I am a Master in Computer Science student from University of Alberta, affiliated with the [BLINC Lab](https://blinclab.ca/) and [Amii](https://www.amii.ca/). I am advised by [Dr. Patrick Pilarski](https://pilarski.github.io/) and [Dr. Ahmed Shehata](https://blinclab.ca/members/shehata/), working on upper-limb prothesis robotics. 

My current research interests are AI for healthcare, robotics, and human-machine interface. Previously, I worked at the [Imagination Centre](https://www.imagination-centre.ca/), developing machine learning and software solutions for rehabilitational brain-computer interface.
